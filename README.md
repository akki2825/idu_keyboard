# Idu Mishmi Language Keyboard
The official keyboard for the Idu Mishmi language. This is a fork of [HeliBoard](https://github.com/Helium314/HeliBoard), a privacy-conscious and customizable open-source keyboard based on AOSP / OpenBoard. 

Features full support for Idu Mishmi with custom accent markers and diacritics. Does not use internet permission, and thus is 100% offline.

# About This Fork

This Idu Mishmi Language Keyboard is based on [HeliBoard](https://github.com/Helium314/HeliBoard), which is itself based on [OpenBoard](https://github.com/openboard-team/openboard) and AOSP Keyboard. We extend our gratitude to the HeliBoard project and its contributors for providing an excellent foundation for this specialized Idu Mishmi Language keyboard implementation.

**Key differences from HeliBoard:**
- Official support for Idu Mishmi language and script
- Custom accent markers and diacritics specific to Idu Mishmi
- Optimized layout and popup keys for Idu Mishmi typing
- Bilingual English-Idu Mishmi support
